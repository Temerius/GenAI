              "  'reversed': 'When the Fool card is reversed, you are encountering an unfinished side of yourself, a part still caught in the shadows of ignorance or immaturity. An emotional reflex or psychological attitude could be holding you back from responding authentically and naturally.',\n",

There is no advantage to be gained by thinking you possess the knowledge, power, or control to direct reality. Open and receive without question, instead of trying to manage what's happening right now. The Fool has no ambition to manipulate a specific outcome. Just be happy to be part of the whole.\",\n",

The Fool is often portrayed as an empty headed simpleton unaware of the forces that move him to and fro, following his impulses. But tradition tells us that this Fool has a secret that protects him: the magic of synchronicity. He proceeds without calculation, spontaneously, without hesitation or resistance.',\n",

Under the circumstances, you can't be too certain about anything, but things could still turn out quite well. Everything is in flux for you, and there may be no set career direction right now. This can either create a feeling of panic or relief. Without a blueprint, you are freed up from rules, restrictions and systems you have been both limited by and dependent upon. On the other hand, there is nothing in place now to prevent you from doing something really stupid, except your own good sense. See that you remember to use it!\",\n",

Perhaps you feel it should be someone else who communicates these insights or challenges. Perhaps you are uncomfortable with taking a leadership position, even a temporary one.',\n",
              "  'advice': 'Have faith in your innate creativity. The Magician advises you give your questioning nature and free-associating mind plenty of room to explore the subject at hand.
